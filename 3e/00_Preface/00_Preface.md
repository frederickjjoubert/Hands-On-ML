## Road Map

### Part 1 - The Fundamentals of Machine Learning

- What ML is, what problems it tries to solve, and the main categories and fundamental concepts of its systems.
- The steps in a typical ML project.
- Learning by fitting a model to data.
- Optimizing a cost function
- Handling, cleaning, and preparing data.
- Selecting and engineering features.
- Selecting a model and tuning hyperparamters using cross-validation.
- The challenges of ML, in particular underfitting and overfitting (the bias / variance tradeoff).
- The most common ML algorithms:
  - Linear and Polynomial Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-nearest neighbors
  - SVMs
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Ensemble Methods
- Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight "The curse of dimensionality".
- Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation, and anomaly detection.

### Part 2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- What neural nets are and what they're good for.
- Building and training neural nets using TensorFlow and Keras.
- The most important NN architectures:
  - Feedforward NNs for tabular data.
  - Convolutional NNs for computer vision.
  - Recurrent NNs and long short-term memory (LSTM) nets for sequence processing.
  - Encoder-decoders and transformers for natural language processing (and more).
  - Autoencoders.
  - Generative adversarial networks (GANs).
  - Diffusion models for generative learning.
- Techniques for training deep neural nets.
- How to build an agent (e.g. a bot in a game) that can learn good strategies through trial and error, using reinforcement learning.
- Loading and preprocessing large amounts of data efficiently.
- Training and deploying TensorFlow models at scale.
