## Notes

A note to self: This book is an absolute abundance of information. I feel like I'm scrambling to take as many notes as I can to try to remember the material, but I think there's just too much material to do that effectively. So I'm go to purposefully abandon taking meticulous notes in order to maintain the necessary momentum to finish the book. I'll focus on the code and what I think are the most important concepts, but otherwise I'm going to have to accept that I can't store all this information in my head and instead come back to the book as a reference when I need to and when I'm working on a project.
